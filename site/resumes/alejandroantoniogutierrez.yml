        As a Technology Consulting Assistant, I provide operational, functional, and technical support across multiple SAP and Fiori environments for international clients. My responsibilities include analyzing incidents, validating system behavior, executing tests in development and UAT environments, and supporting enhancements, upgrades, and corrections across various modules. 
        I collaborate daily with cross‑functional teams—both client-side and internal—to ensure issues are resolved efficiently and system processes remain stable and accurate.
        I manage contract‑related validations, troubleshoot data inconsistencies, coordinate updates with development teams, and assist in implementing improvements requested by business stakeholders. My role also includes preparing and reviewing information for production changes, supporting end‑users, documenting findings, and ensuring smooth communication between technical teams and business units. 
        Through these tasks, I help maintain the integrity, performance, and reliability of SAP processes for high‑volume production environments.
